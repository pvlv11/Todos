# Todos
A simple todo app built with C#, WPF and Supabase on .NET 7.0 Windows stack.

# How to use
To be able to run the app you need a Supabase database created and set up. What you need exactly is a `todos` table with `todo` column. When creating the table leave primary key untouched.

To connect to the database provide API url and apikey when prompted. It will be then saved in user environmental variables.

To provide new database credentials use adequate button in the menu.

# Future improvements
Add users and authentication.
